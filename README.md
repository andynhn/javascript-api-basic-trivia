# javascript-api-basic-trivia
Used an open trivia API to build a basic trivia game. 20 random questions from the API are generated when the page loads. Used jQuery to manipulate the DOM in order to display the questions in the HTML. Will later implement advanced features to improve the UI and game mechanics.
